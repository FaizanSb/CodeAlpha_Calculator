🧮 Calculator Project
📌 Overview

This is a simple Calculator Application built as part of an internship task.
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations along with additional features like percentage calculation, clear, sign conversion, and correction (backspace).

🚀 Features

✔️ Basic Operations – Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
✔️ Percentage (%) – Quickly calculate percentage values
✔️ Clear (C) – Resets the entire input
✔️ Sign Conversion (+/−) – Converts a number to negative or positive
✔️ Correction (⌫) – Works like backspace to delete the last digit/character
✔️ User-Friendly UI – Easy to use and responsive design

🛠️ Functions Explained

Addition (+) → Adds two numbers

Subtraction (−) → Subtracts second number from first

Multiplication (×) → Multiplies two numbers

Division (÷) → Divides first number by second (error handled for ÷0)

Percentage (%) → Converts number into percentage (e.g., 50% of 200 = 100)

Clear (C) → Resets display/input

Convert to Negative/Positive (±) → Changes the sign of the current number

Correction (⌫) → Deletes last entered digit (backspace)
